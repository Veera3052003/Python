"""
Yes, in terms of time complexity:
O(n) is better than O(n log n) because it scales linearly with the size of the input, while O(n log n) grows faster as the input size increases.
For example, if you have an input of size 100, an O(n) algorithm will take 100 steps, while an O(n log n) algorithm will take about 200 steps. If you have an input of size 1000, an O(n) algorithm will take 1000 steps, while an O(n log n) algorithm will take about 3000 steps.

# Note:
# The problem of finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray within a list can be solved efficiently using the Kadane's algorithm.
# One other algorithm that can be used is the divide-and-conquer algorithm. This algorithm works by recursively dividing the list into two halves, finding the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in each half, and then combining the two results to find the largest sum of a contiguous subarray in the entire list.

# Another question: Modify the function to return both the maximum sum and the corresponding subarray.
